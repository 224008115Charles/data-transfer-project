## Current State

### Tasks
At a semi reasonable MVP level. Tasks and task lists are transferred.
recurring tasks are not.

### Photos
At an MVP level. Photos and albums are transferred however metadata is not.

### Calendar
At a proof of concept state (e.g. very rough).  Basic calendar entries are
moved.  However recurring meetings are not handled correctly, nor are reminders
accounted for.
