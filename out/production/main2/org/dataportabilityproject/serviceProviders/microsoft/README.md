This doesn't come close to working.

Still trying to figure out the auth for MS.

The samples and libraries are very much focused on .Net and not Java.

It might we worth it/interesting to write these in .Net and figure
out how to incorporate multiple language adapters into the project
now.  It is very likely that other developers will want to develop
in the language of their choice and not be forced into Java.
